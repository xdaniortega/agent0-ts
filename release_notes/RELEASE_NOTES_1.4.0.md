# Release Notes — 1.4.0

This release improves dashboard ergonomics for feedback browsing and analytics.

## ERC-8004 Jan23 alignment (spec + ABIs)

This release also aligns the SDK with the updated ERC-8004 spec (`int128` reputation values, `services` registration files) and the Jan 23 2026 ABIs.

### Breaking changes

- **Off-chain feedback file format is now spec-only**
  - Feedback files written by the SDK include the ERC-8004 envelope fields and use the spec structure (nested `mcp` / `a2a` / `oasf` objects).
  - Legacy flat fields (e.g. `skill`, `task`, `context`, `capability`, `name`) are no longer supported/produced as a compatibility layer.

- **Agent wallet read API**
  - **Rename:** SDK method `agent.getAgentWallet()` is now `agent.getWallet()` (reads the verified wallet from chain).
  - Under the hood the contract call is `IdentityRegistry.getAgentWallet(agentId) -> address` (Jan 2026 ABI); the SDK treats the **zero address** as “unset”.

### Notable changes

- **Reputation value type**
  - Reputation registry values are now treated as `(value:int128, valueDecimals:uint8)` (previously `int256` in older ABIs/docs).
  - Value encoding clamps to the contract bound: `abs(value) <= 1e38`.

- **Registration file shape**
  - SDK-generated registration files now emit `services` (spec key). The SDK continues to accept legacy `endpoints` when reading.
  - Registration output uses `x402Support` (camelCase) and `supportedTrust` (spec key).

- **Default trust model**
  - When creating a new agent, if no trust model is provided, the SDK defaults to `reputation`.

## Feedback search

### `SDK.searchFeedback()` now supports reviewer-only and multi-agent queries

**Non-breaking change:** `FeedbackSearchFilters.agentId` is now optional.

**New:** `FeedbackSearchFilters.agents?: AgentId[]` lets you search across multiple agents in one call.

This enables the “Feedback Given” use case (query **all feedback written by a wallet** across all agents) without needing to know which agents were reviewed.

```ts
// Unchanged: search feedback for a specific agent
const forAgent = await sdk.searchFeedback({ agentId: '11155111:123' });

// NEW: search feedback given by a reviewer wallet (across all agents)
const given = await sdk.searchFeedback({
  reviewers: ['0x742d35cc6634c0532925a3b844bc9e7595f0beb7'],
});

// NEW: search feedback across multiple agents
const multi = await sdk.searchFeedback({
  agents: ['11155111:123', '11155111:456', '11155111:789'],
});
```

### Safety: empty searches are rejected

Because `agentId` is now optional, `sdk.searchFeedback({})` would otherwise become possible. In 1.4.0 the SDK throws if you provide **no filters**, to avoid accidentally querying arbitrary global feedback.


## Transactions (write calls): submitted-by-default lifecycle handles

**Breaking change:** write methods return a **transaction handle** immediately after submission (tx hash available), instead of returning a “successful” result before the tx is mined.

This makes the lifecycle explicit:
- **submitted**: you have a tx hash (broadcast/accepted), but it may still revert
- **confirmed**: you explicitly wait for mining/confirmations and get the final result + receipt

This pattern applies to any write method that returns a `TransactionHandle<T>` (e.g. `sdk.giveFeedback`, `agent.registerIPFS`, `sdk.appendResponse`, `sdk.revokeFeedback`, etc.):

```ts
// submitted-by-default: you immediately have a tx hash
const tx = await sdk.giveFeedback('11155111:123', 85, 'quality', 'latency');
console.log(tx.hash);

// explicitly wait for mining/confirmations (1 confirmation = mined)
const { receipt, result } = await tx.waitConfirmed({ timeoutMs: 180_000, confirmations: 1 });
console.log(receipt.status);
console.log(result);
```

## `giveFeedback`: fixed gas limit (300,000)

The TypeScript SDK sets a fixed gas limit of **300,000** for `giveFeedback` transactions to bypass unreliable `eth_estimateGas` behavior (notably for calls with multiple dynamic `string` parameters) and avoid failures before the wallet confirmation prompt.
